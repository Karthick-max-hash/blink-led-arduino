# blink-led-arduino


This is a basic Arduino project that blinks an LED on and off using digital pin 13. It was built using Tinkercad Circuits for simulation and code testing.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Turns an LED ON for 1 second
- Turns it OFF for 1 second
- Repeats the cycle continuously

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Details

| Arduino Pin | Component | Description        |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|
| D13         | LED (+)   | Long leg of LED    |
| GND         | LED (â€“)   | Short leg via 220Î© resistor |

## ðŸ“„ Arduino Code

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);  // Turn LED on
  delay(1000);             // Wait 1 second
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);   // Turn LED off
  delay(1000);             // Wait 1 second
}
